## Fleet Dash Web

This is the actual dashboard, the visualization hub. It opens a websocket to core, and listens for relevant events. Itll injest em, and update any dashboard widgets that care. Due to the messaging system, it's very easy to build new widgets.

It's built with Vue3, Vite, and TailwindCSS. This combo has been a pleasure to work with.
